# Smoke and Mirrors: How to hide in Microsoft Azure - Aled Mehta and Christian Philipov


## Why should we care?

•	Because Attackers do.

## Microsoft Entra, what is logged in?

•	Microsoft Graph
•	Provisioning 
•	Sign in.
•	Audit
•	Identity Risk
•	Global Secure Access

## What is not logged?

•	Azure AD  Graph.
•	Ibiza IAM


## Azure Machine Learning:

•	Used for ML
•	A platform for teams to make use of ML models.
•	Natively integrates with Azure data service.

## What is cool about Azure ML?

•	Allows integration of SQL, DB and storage account.
•	Has a separate studio to manage workspace.
•	Always a good combination for research.

## How can Azure ML can access data stores?

•	Credential based.
•	Identity based.

## What can we do?

•	Understand our tools.
•	Use available logging to fit our needs. 
•	Continuously evaluate our needs.


# a) Bandit oh-five. Solve Over The Wire: Bandit the first five levels (0-4).


### Bandit Level 0
Level Goal
The goal of this level is for I log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1. My solution given below:

### Bandit Level 0 → Level 1
The goal of this level is for I to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1. My solution is given below:

### Bandit Level 1 → Level 2
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory. Writing ls -alps I got list and use cat ./- to find out net level password

### Bandit Level 2 → Level 3
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory. To do this use bandit2 passwork got from level 2. The write ls -aps to get the list. From this list I understood paasword store in the file called sapces in this file name than I write commend  cat "spaces in this filename" to get password. My solution is given below:

### Bandit Level 3 → Level 4
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory. To find out this password I use bandit3 log in and password. Then write command cd inhere . To get inhere file list writr command ls -al which gave me list of all inhere directory. To retrive this level password I used command cat ...Hiding-From-You command and got the password. My solution is given below

# b) Can't fish. Disable networking and show that packets don't go trough. For example, use 'ping 1.1.1.1' (Cloudfare DNS server) or 'ping 8.8.8.8' (Google DNS server).

### ping is a network utility that sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests to a target. ping 8.8.8.8 is DNS server. So without with enable network when I wrote command it show below result. Which means, the message "64 bytes from 8.8.8.8" indicates successful communication with the target. Each line shows the packet size, sequence number (icmp_seq), Time-to-Live (TTL) value, and the round-trip time in milliseconds.

### After disbale interent and Ethenet connect when I wrote command in terminal ping 8.8.8.8. It shows below results. It shows the  message "Destination Host Unreachable" indicates that the network interface is unable to reach the target host, confirming that the network is disabled. The repeated "icmp_seq" numbers show that multiple packets were sent, but none were successful.

# c) Local only. Portscan your own computer using "localhost" address. It's illegal to portscan computers you don't own. Disconnect computer from the Internet while testing. Analyze your results.

### To do this Portscan my own computer at first I installed nmap to my device wrote terminal command "sudo apt-get install nmap" with enable internet and ethernet connettion of my home. This is my solution below how I install nmap successfully. 

### Then I scan local host by writting command " sudo nmap -A localhost". Then localhost gave the below solution. 
#### Port 25/tcp open: This indicates that port 22, which is typically used by the SSH (Secure Shell) service, is open and ready to accept connections. If I have an SSH server running on your system, this result is expected.
#### 998 closed ports: This means that most ports (in this example, 998 out of 1000) are closed and not accepting connections. This is usually a good sign from a security perspective because it reduces potential attack surfaces. 


# d) Daemon. Install a daemon (a server application) and port scan again. For example, you could install Apache web server or OpenSSH secure remote shell. Analyze the differences to scan without the daemon.
