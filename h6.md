 € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
Cryptography is about solving problems. Protocols are series of steps involving multiple parties designed to accomplish a task. 

•	Cryptographic protocols use encryption to ensure secrecy, authentication, and integrity, preventing eavesdropping and cheating. 

Types of protocols:

•	Arbitrated: A trusted third party ensures fairness.
•	Adjudicated: A third party resolves disputes when cheating is suspected. 
•	Self-enforcing: the protocol itself guarantees fairness with no need for external parties.
•	Protocols face passive attacks (eavesdropping) and active attacks (manipulation of messages).

Symmetric cryptography communication protocol summary:

•	Secure communication process: 
1.	Alice and Bob agree on a cryptosystem and a secret key.
2.	Alice encrypts her message using the agreed key and sends it to Bob.
3.	Bob decrypts the message using the same key.

•	Potential Attacks:
1.	Eve(passive): Can eavesdrop and attempt to cryptanalyze if she intercepts the ciphertext or learns the key.
2.	Mallory(active): Can disrupt or alter communication, potentially substituting messages if he gains the key.
•	Key management challenges:
1.	Keys must be kept secret, making distribution difficult.
2.	If a key is compromised, all associated messages are vulnerable.
3.	Managing keys for large networks becomes complex, as the number of keys grows rapidly with more users. 
•	One-way functions:
1.	Are easy to compute in one direction but difficult to reverse. 
2.	There is no mathematical proof that one-way functions exist, but many practical examples suggest they can be constructed. 
3.	These functions cannot be directly used for encryption because they cannot be easily reversed for decryption. 
4.	Trapdoor one-way functions include a secret that allows reversing the function, enabling practical use in public-key cryptography. 
5.	The real-world analogy: disassembling a watch is easy, reassembling is difficult, but having instructions makes it manageable. 
•	One-way hash functions:
1.	Converts variable-length input into a fixed length output, ensuring data integrity.
2.	They are easy to compute but hard to reverse, meaning it is difficult to find a pre-image that matches a given hash value. 
3.	A good one-way hash is collision-resistant, making it hard to find two different inputs with the same hash value.
4.	Hash functions are public and useful for verifying data, such as file integrity or financial transactions. 
5.	Messages authentication codes combine a one way with a secret key, ensuring only those with the key can verify the hash.
•	Communications using public-key cryptography:
1.	Public-key cryptography uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, solving the problem of key distribution.
2.	Public-key cryptosystem example: Alice encrypts her message using Bob’s public key, and only Bob, with his private key, can decrypt it.
3.	Public-key cryptography is computationally slow compared to symmetric cryptography and vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attacks, so it is mainly used to encrypt session keys in practice. 
4.	Hybrid cryptosystems combine public-key cryptography and symmetric algorithms. 
5.	Merkle’s puzzles were an early approach to public-key cryptography, where eavesdroppers need significantly more effort to break the encryption than the legitimate parties to communicate securely. 
•	Digital signatures:
Provide authenticity and integrity to electronic documents, similar to handwritten signatures. 

1.	Limitations of physical signatures: 
a.	Vulnerable to forgery and tampering.
b.	Assumptions of authenticity and unforgeability are often flawed.
2.	Challenges in digital context: 
a.	Digital documents can be easily copied and modified.
b.	Traditional signatures are insufficient for ensuring integrity.
3.	Symmetric Cryptography with Arbitrator:
a.	Involves a trusted third party
b.	Alice encrypts the message, Trent verifies, and re-encrypts for Bob.
c.	Effective but creates bottleneck and trust issues. 
4.	Public-key Cryptography:
a.	Alice signs with her private key, Bob verifies with her public key.
b.	Eliminates the need for a third party.
c.	Ensures authenticity, unforgeability and document integrity.
5.	Timestamp to prevent signature reuse:
a.	Prevents duplication of signed documents.
b.	Unique timestamp added to each signature to ensure it is valid only once. 
6.	Efficiency with one-way hash functions:
a.	Instead of signing the entire document, a hash is created and signed.
b.	Improves efficiency wile maintaining security.
7.	Nonrepudiation and mitigation strategies:
a.	Digital signatures aim to prevent denial of signing.
b.	Timestamps and records can limit the ability to repudiate signatures. 
8.	Real-world Applications:
a.	Used in various fields, including finance, legal documents, international treaties. 
Digital signatures with encryption:

•	Protocol combines signatures with public key cryptography for secure communication, where Alice signs a message, encrypts it with Bob’s public key, and Bob decrypts and verifies it. 
•	Key steps:
o	Alice signs and encrypts her message for Bob.
o	Bob decrypts, verifies the signature, and can send a receipt back to Alice.
•	Security Considerations: Signing before encrypting prevents tampering and legal issues, using separate key pairs for signing and encryption enhances security.
•	Resend attack defense: Use different operations for encryption and signing, employ timestamps, and verify message clarity before sending receipts.
•	Public key validation: Public keys should be obtained from a secure database, with a key certification authority signing them to ensure authenticity, mitigating risks from adversaries like Mallory. 
Random and pseudo-random-sequence generation:

•	Importance of randomness: Standard random number generators are often inadequate for cryptography, as they are predictable and may introduce vulnerabilities.
•	Pseudo-Random Sequences: these sequences mimic randomness and pass statistical tests are still periodic; they must appear indistinguishable from true randomness.
•	Cryptographically secure pseudo-random sequences: they must be unpredictable and not compressible unless the key is known, making them suitable for cryptographic applications. 
•	Real random sequences: Defined by their inability to be reliably reproduced these sequences are crucial for secure key generation and one-time pads.
•	Philosophical questions: The nature of randomness and its preservation in deterministic systems raises compels issues in cryptography.
