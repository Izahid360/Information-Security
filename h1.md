## Threat Modeling Manifesto (Braiterman et al 2020)

### What is threat Modeling?

Threat modeling is analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics. A threat model asks 4 key questions based on which we try to find a solution. The four questions are:	

1.	What are we working on? 
Identify the assets which are important and vulnerable in our application or system. For example, our data, server, intellectual properties etc.

3.	What can go wrong?
Considering the potential threats such as cyber-attacks, data breaches, unauthorized accesses etc.

5.	What are we going to do about it?
Developing and implementing strategies to mitigate the risk which were identified in the previous steps as threats and vulnerabilities.

7.	Did we do a good enough job?
Evaluation of our strategies and structures and judge if the solution is effective enough.

### Who should use threat modeling?
Basically, anyone who have concerns about their privacy, security and safety should consider using threat modeling.

##Threat Modeling Manifesto: 

According to “Threat Modeling Manifesto” by Braiterman et al. (2020) the threat modeling manifesto works as a guide or method to use the modeling as needed. The manifesto identifies 2 following guidelines. 

1.	Values: The value in the threat modeling has relative importance. While there is value in one thing the model explores other sectors of the system.
   
3.	Principles: The threat model principle is to make sure it aligns with the organization. Ensuring the privacy and security the outcome should add value to the stakeholders.
