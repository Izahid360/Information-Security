## Threat Modeling Manifesto (Braiterman et al 2020)

### What is threat Modeling?

Threat modeling is analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics. A threat model asks 4 key questions based on which we try to find a solution. The four questions are:	

1.	What are we working on? 
Identify the assets which are important and vulnerable in our application or system. For example, our data, server, intellectual properties etc.

3.	What can go wrong?
Considering the potential threats such as cyber-attacks, data breaches, unauthorized accesses etc.

5.	What are we going to do about it?
Developing and implementing strategies to mitigate the risk which were identified in the previous steps as threats and vulnerabilities.

7.	Did we do a good enough job?
Evaluation of our strategies and structures and judge if the solution is effective enough.

### Who should use threat modeling?
Basically, anyone who have concerns about their privacy, security and safety should consider using threat modeling.

##Threat Modeling Manifesto: 

According to “Threat Modeling Manifesto” by Braiterman et al. (2020) the threat modeling manifesto works as a guide or method to use the modeling as needed. The manifesto identifies 2 following guidelines. 

1.	Values: The value in the threat modeling has relative importance. While there is value in one thing the model explores other sectors of the system.
   
3.	Principles: The threat model principle is to make sure it aligns with the organization. Ensuring the privacy and security the outcome should add value to the stakeholders. 

### Threat modeling patterns:
•	Systematic approach: Be through with privacy and have structured approach.

•	Informed creativity: Encourage creative and new ideas.

•	Varied Viewpoint: Have a diverse team with various skillset.

•	Useful Toolkit: Include supporting tools to increase productivity.

•	Theory into practice: Successful implementation of the learned theory.

### Anti-Patterns:
•	Hero threat modeler: Not depending on one’s capability.

•	Admiration for the problem: Admit the problem in hand and try to find solution. 

•	Tendency to overfocus: Do not lose the focus. 

•	Perfect representation: Have multiple threat modeling present. 

## Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course (Shostack 2022):

In this course author explain the threat model and it's process. A Threat modeling tries to answer 4 basic questions.
#### 1.	What are we working on?
Identify where threat modeling is needed. How to approach toward providing security.

#### 2.	What can go wrong?
Consider all the threat and risk that can occur. Figure out risk using STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege). Also analyze who might try to cause these risk problems.

#### 3.	What are we going to do about it?
Use META (mitigate, eliminate, transfer, or accept) for all the threats that have been found. Try to ensure security and reduce risk at every section of the system. 

#### 4.	Did we do a good job?
The final step is to observe all the other actions have been taken before. Regularly check if there is any new threats coming or the other old threats have been eliminated. Most of all if the system is correctly running smoothly, take feedbacks and recommendations. 


## OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet:

Cheat modeling is done usually in the early SDLC such as design. This process in not done once and never again. Threat modeling need to be maintained, refined and updated alongside the system. 
### Advantages of Threat Modeling

#### Identify Risks Early-On: 
Allows the system to address the risk early on and build the security accordingly rather than after some breach happens.
Increased Security Awareness: Threats modeling encourages the participants to think out of the box. More creative and critical analysis comes to mind. Helps to think more like a attacker.

#### Improved Visibility of Target of Evaluation (TOE): 
Applying this model requires a very thorough understanding of the system that has been evaluated. This helps to increase the visibility about the system. 

#### Addressing Each Question

There is no one right question in every case of threat modeling. Every new case has new question and different answers. So all the 4 key questions of threat modeling must be addressed properly. 

#### Threat Identification
STRIDE is a popular threat modeling technique. STRIDE groups threats into 6 different sections and systematically evaluate how these threats may be handled. The 6 sections of threats are. 
• Spoofing:  Authenticity – Attacker steals the authentication token and uses it.

•	Tampering: Integrity – Manipulates the system.

•	Repudiation: Non-repudiability – Manipulates the log.

•	Information Disclosure: Confidentiality – Extract data from the database. 

•	Denial of Service: Availability – Locks real users out of their own account.

•	Elevation of Privileges: Authorization- Tempers with JWT to change their roles. 


### Threat Modeling and Development team

#### Challenges:
Many participants from the development team lacks required knowledge about security which effects the outcome. This model is a complex and time-consuming process which asks a deep evaluation, this might get frustrating. Communication and collaboration with different department is also challenging. 
Addressing the challenges: Regular security training of the development team. Promote security culture within the organization. 

## Darknet Diaries: Episode 147: Tornado:
The episode was about the theft of Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston 1990. Till today it is one the most infamous theft in history. Several paintings were stolen and none of which were recovered. So the case remain unsolved. So how do you sell these valuable paintings? Maybe through darknet! Maybe using Cryptocurrency!? 


## a) Security Hygiene:

Security is a very delicate and sensitive matter. Both organization and individual should practice a certain level of security hygiene. 
•	Regular software updates. Update the system and applications regularly.

•	Strong password is very important. Have a complex and strong password.

•	Endpoint security: Always use a up to date anti-virus. 

•	Always have backup for data.

•	Ensure a secured network.

•	Regular security training. 

•	Monitoring and logging.

•	Third party security management.

•	Physical security. 

## Imaginary Company: FitMe Gym 
FitMe is a modern fitness center chain that provides a range of services. The services include personal training, competitions, and nutritional advising.
Threat Model Overview
 ### What Are We Working On?
•	Personal Data: Sensitive information such as health data, physical conditions. 

•	Management System: System for memberships and operations.

•	Payment Processing System: Handles financial transactions.

•	Employee Credentials: Employees personal data and work status.

•	Clients Portal: Account books and card information. 

### What Can Go Wrong?
•	Scamming: Phishing attacks could happen using clients’ credentials. 

•	Data Breach: If the sensitive data is stolen there can be a lot of severe consequences.

•	Information disclosure: If the attacker has sensitive data. There is threat of the disclosure of that information.

•	Insider Threat: Potential tampering by employees.

### What Are We Going to Do About It?
•	Enforce multi-factor authentication.

•	Regular update of the system and the applications. 

•	Build strong firewalls and ensure all the tools required are available. 

•	Train the development team properly and continuously. 

### Did We Do a Good Enough Job?
•	Regular check up on the system and security assessments. 

•	Always monitor what is happening and if any real time incident happens observe how the system worked.

•	Have a third party and external expert opinion.
