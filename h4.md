## A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

# Definition: Ensures users cannot acct beyond their authorized permissions, preventing unauthorized data access, modification, or business function misuse.

# Vulnerabilities:

•	Violation of the least privilege principle or deny by default, granting access to unauthorized users. 
•	Bypassing access control checks via URL manipulation, parameter tampering, or attack tools.
•	Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): Viewing or editing another user’s data by using their unique identifier. 
•	Missing access controls for POST, PUT, DELETE API methods.
•	Privilege escalation: Acting as a user without authentication or as an admin while logged in as standard user.
•	Metadata manipulation: Tampering with tokens (JWTs, cookies) to gain elevated privileges.
•	CORS misconfiguration: Allows access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.
•	Force browsing: Accessing restricted pages without proper authentication or privilege. 

#	Prevention Measures:


•	Use access control only by trusted server-side code or server-less APIs.
•	Deny by default, except for public resources.
•	Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them across the application.
•	Enforce record ownership rather than trusting users to control access to data.
•	Ensure unique business rules are enforced via domain models.
•	Disable directory listing and remove sensitive files form web roots.
•	Log access control failures and alert admins for repeated issues. 
•	Rate limit API controller access to mitigate automated attacks.
•	Invalidate sessions after logout and keep JWT tokens short-lived or follow OAuth standards for long-lived tokens.

# Example Attack scenarios:

1.	Scenario 1:  Attacker modifies the acct parameter in a URL to access another user’s account (IDOR).
2.	Scenario 2: Attacker force-browses admin pages without proper privileges. 




## A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration



# Application Vulnerabilities: Missing security hardening, unnecessary features enabled, unchanged default accounts, overly informative error messages, insecure sever settings, missing security headers, and outdated or vulnerable components increases application risk.

# Prevention: Implement a repeatable hardening process, minimize installed features, regularly update configurations and patches, segment application architecture for security, send security headers, and automate configuration verification. 

# Example Scenarios: Attackers exploit sample apps left on production servers, enable directory listing to access sensitive files, view detailed error messages to expose vulnerabilities, or access cloud-stored due to insecure default permissions. 


## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components


# Vulnerabilities: Lack of component version tracking, use off outdated or vulnerable software, failure to scan for vulnerabilities, delayed patching, untested library updates, and insecure configurations. 

# Prevention: Implement a patch management process, continuously monitor and inventory components, obtain secure and signed packages, and ensure ongoing monitoring and updates throughout the application’s lifecycle.

# Example scenarios: Struts 2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) caused major breaches, loT devices pose patching challenges, and tools like Shodan can expose unpatched systems like those affected by Heartbleed. 


## A03:2021 – Injection

# Vulnerabilities: Lack of validation, dynamic queries without parameterization, and hostile data used in queries or commands can lead to various types of injection attacks, including SQL, NoSQL, and OS command injections. 

# Prevention: Use safe APIs with parameterized queries, apply server-side input validation, escape special characters, and sue SQL controls like LIMIT to minimize the impact of injection attacks. 

# Example Scenarios: Vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is used in SQL or HQL queries, allowing attackers or inject malicious code and alter query results (e.g. using ‘UNION SELECT SLEEP (10);--)
