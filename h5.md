## Chapter 1 : Foundation

* Plaintext: Original message to be encrypted.
* Encryption: Transforms plaintext into ciphertext.
* Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext.
* Cryptography: Science off securing messages; involes encryption and decryption. 
* Cryptanalysis: Science off breaking encryted messages.
* Key: Secret value used in encryption and decryption. 

##### Anthenticaton, Integrity, Nonrepudation: Ensure message origin, prevent tampering, and deny false claims, respectively. 

##### Modern Cryptography: Relies on key-based algorithms, not restricted ones. 

##### Symmetric algorithms: Use the same key for encryption and decryption; key must remain secret. 

##### Public-key algorithms: Use different keys for encryption (public) and decryption (private); public key can se shared. 

##### Cryptanalysis: The science of breaking ciphers to reveal plaintext or keys. 

##### types of attacks: Ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext, chosen-ciphertext, and adaptive attacks. 

##### Security Assessment: The strength of an algorithm is based on the cost and time to break it relative to the value of the data. 

##### Types of breaks: Total break, global decution instance deduction and informatio deduction. 

##### Brute-Froce attacks: Involes testing all possible keys; effectiveness depends on the algorithm's complexity.

##### Complexity Measures: Evaluated through data requirements, processing time, and storage needs, impacting how easily an attack can be executed. 

##### Steganography: Hides secret messages within innnocuous content to conceal thier existance. 

##### Transposition Ciphers: Rearrange charaters, valnerable to frequency analysis.

##### Rotor Machines: Use rotating disks for encryption; exemplified by the enigma.

##### Simple XOR: Weak symmetric encryption; easily broken with basic techniques. 

##### One time Pads: Perfect security if used correctly; impracticla for long messages.

##### Cryptographic Algorithms: DES- Symmetric standard; RSA- public key for encryption; DSA- digital signatures only. 

#### a) Pretty Good indeed. Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)

#### To encrypt and decrypt a message using GnuPG (GPG) with PGP public key cryptography, follow these detailed steps I followed: 

##### Step 1 : install gnupg - To install I open my linux terminal and write the command below:

*brew install gnupg

##### Step 2: Generate a Key Pair - To generate a key pair I wrote in terminal following command:

 * gpg --full-generate-key
 * When prompted, select the key type. The default RSA and RSA (option 1) is fine.
 * Choose a key size 4096 which is more secure).
 * Set an expiration date if desired. I can choose "0" for no expiration.
 * Enter your name and email address:
   Name: Zahid
Email: izahid360@gmail.com
 * Set a passphrase to protect my key.

##### Step 3: To verify the key is created successffully write the command: 

*gpg --list-keys . To see the list of new key.

##### Step 4: Export  Public Key - Export my public key to share it with others by writting command below:
 
*gpg --export --armor izahid360@gmail.com > zahid_public_key.asc
This command creates a file named zahid_public_key.asc containing public key in ASCII format.

##### Step 5: Encrypt a Messag - Create a plaintext message file. For example, create a file named secretmessage.txt by writing below command:

* echo "Hello, this is a secret message from Zahid!" > secretmessage.txt

Encrypt the message using my public key:

*  gpg --output encrypted_scretmessage.gpg --encrypt --recipient izahid360@gmail.com scretmessage.txt

##### Step 6: Decrypt the Message - To decrypt the encrypted message, run in terminal :

* gpg --output decrypted_scretmessage.txt --decrypt encrypted_scretmessage.gpg

Here I need to enter the passphrase that set for my private key.


#### b) Password manager, open and cloudless. Choose a password manager that 1) works without cloud 2) is free, open source sofware. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.

#### For a password manager that is open-source, works without cloud, and is compatible with macOS Big Sur 11.7.10, KeePassxc can be a good option. I would like to install this to my machine because 

###### This software is open Source which  ffully transparent and auditable code.

###### Keeps my passwords stored locally on my device, without any cloud service.

#### To install KeePassxc : I went their website and download it. 

#### Launch KeePassXC: Go to my Applications folder and open KeePassXC. On first launch, I need to allow it in mysecurity settings (System Preferences > Security & Privacy). 

#### Create a New Database: To create a new Database open KeePassXC, click on “Create new database.” Set a strong master password. This password will protect all other passwords. Save my database file to a secure location on my computer.

#### Add a New Entry: To click on the “Add Entry” button. Fill-up in the necessary fields (e.g., title, username, password, URL). KeePassXC generate a strong password using the built-in password generator. Save the entry.

#### Retrieving Passwords: To double-click on an entry to view or copy password for use.Organizing Entries:

#### I could  create groups or categories to organize my passwords better.
