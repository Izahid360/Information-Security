## Chapter 1 : Foundation

Plaintext: Original message to be encrypted.
Encryption: Transforms plaintext into ciphertext.
Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext.
Cryptography: Science off securing messages; involes encryption and decryption. 
Cryptanalysis: Science off breaking encryted messages.
Key: Secret value used in encryption and decryption. 

Anthenticaton, Integrity, Nonrepudation: Ensure message origin, prevent tampering, and deny false claims, respectively. 

Modern Cryptography: Relies on key-based algorithms, not restricted ones. 

Symmetric algorithms: Use the same key for encryption and decryption; key must remain secret. 

Public-key algorithms: Use different keys for encryption (public) and decryption (private); public key can se shared. 

Cryptanalysis: The science of breaking ciphers to reveal plaintext or keys. 

types of attacks: Ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext, chosen-ciphertext, and adaptive attacks. 

Security Assessment: The strength of an algorithm is based on the cost and time to break it relative to the value of the data. 

Types of breaks: Total break, global decution instance deduction and informatio deduction. 

Brute-Froce attacks: Involes testing all possible keys; effectiveness depends on the algorithm's complexity.

Complexity Measures: Evaluated through data requirements, processing time, and storage needs, impacting how easily an attack can be executed. 

Steganography: Hides secret messages within innnocuous content to conceal thier existance. 

Transposition Ciphers: Rearrange charaters, valnerable to frequency analysis.

Rotor Machines: Use rotating disks for encryption; exemplified by the enigma.

Simple XOR: Weak symmetric encryption; easily broken with basic techniques. 

One time Pads: Perfect security if used correctly; impracticla for long messages.

Cryptographic Algorithms: DES- Symmetric standard; RSA- public key for encryption; DSA- digital signatures only. 

#### a) Pretty Good indeed. Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)


#### b) Password manager, open and cloudless. Choose a password manager that 1) works without cloud 2) is free, open source sofware. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.

#### For a password manager that is open-source, works without cloud, and is compatible with macOS Big Sur 11.7.10, KeePassxc can be a good option. I would like to install this to my machine because 
###### This software is open Source which  ffully transparent and auditable code.
###### Keeps my passwords stored locally on my device, without any cloud service.

####bTo install KeePassxc
I went their website and download it. 

#### Launch KeePassXC: Go to my Applications folder and open KeePassXC. On first launch, I need to allow it in mysecurity settings (System Preferences > Security & Privacy). 

#### Create a New Database: To create a new Database open KeePassXC, click on “Create new database.”
Set a strong master password. This password will protect all other passwords.
Save my database file to a secure location on my computer.

#### Add a New Entry: To click on the “Add Entry” button. Fill-up in the necessary fields (e.g., title, username, password, URL).
KeePassXC generate a strong password using the built-in password generator. Save the entry.

#### Retrieving Passwords: To double-click on an entry to view or copy password for use.Organizing Entries:

I could  create groups or categories to organize my passwords better.
