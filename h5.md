## Chapter 1 : Foundation

Plaintext: Original message to be encrypted.
Encryption: Transforms plaintext into ciphertext.
Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext.
Cryptography: Science off securing messages; involes encryption and decryption. 
Cryptanalysis: Science off breaking encryted messages.
Key: Secret value used in encryption and decryption. 

Anthenticaton, Integrity, Nonrepudation: Ensure message origin, prevent tampering, and deny false claims, respectively. 

Modern Cryptography: Relies on key-based algorithms, not restricted ones. 

Symmetric algorithms: Use the same key for encryption and decryption; key must remain secret. 

Public-key algorithms: Use different keys for encryption (public) and decryption (private); public key can se shared. 

Cryptanalysis: The science of breaking ciphers to reveal plaintext or keys. 

types of attacks: Ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext, chosen-ciphertext, and adaptive attacks. 

Security Assessment: The strength of an algorithm is based on the cost and time to break it relative to the value of the data. 

Types of breaks: Total break, global decution instance deduction and informatio deduction. 

Brute-Froce attacks: Involes testing all possible keys; effectiveness depends on the algorithm's complexity.

Complexity Measures: Evaluated through data requirements, processing time, and storage needs, impacting how easily an attack can be executed. 

Steganography: Hides secret messages within innnocuous content to conceal thier existance. 

Transposition Ciphers: Rearrange charaters, valnerable to frequency analysis.

Rotor Machines: Use rotating disks for encryption; exemplified by the enigma.

Simple XOR: Weak symmetric encryption; easily broken with basic techniques. 

One time Pads: Perfect security if used correctly; impracticla for long messages.

Cryptographic Algorithms: DES- Symmetric standard; RSA- public key for encryption; DSA- digital signatures only.
