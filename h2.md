# Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains


(ATP)advanced persistent threat. Conventional incident response fails to mitigate the risk posed by ATP because they make 2 flawed assumptions, one is response should happen after the point of compromise and the compromise was the result of a fixable flaw. This paper describes an intelligent-driven, threat focused approach to study intrusion from adversary’s perspective. The phase “kill chain” describes the structure of the intrusion and guides based on analysis to inform actionable security intelligence. 

# Indicator and the life cycle:

The fundamental instrument of kill chain model is the indicator. An indicator is any piece of information that describes any sort of intrusion. 3 types of indicators, 

1.	Atomic: Indicators which cannot be broken into smaller parts. Examples are emails addresses, IP addresses, vulnerability identifiers etc. 
2.	Computed: Indicators which are attained data form an incident. Such as hash values, regular expressions. 
3.	Behavioral: Collection of Atomic and computed indicators. An example, the intruder would initially use a backdoor which generated network traffic matching [regular expression] at the rate of [some frequency] to [some IP address], and then replace it with one matching the MD5 hash [value] once access was established.”


analysts will reveal indicators through analysis or collaboration, mature these indicators by leveraging them in their tools, and then utilize them when matching activity is discovered.

# Intrusion kill chain: 


## Reconnaissance:

Primary gathering of information before extensive operation. Research, identification of target such as social relationships, email addresses.

## Weaponization: 

A weaponized payload is crated such as a remote access Trojan or a malfunctioning software. 

## Delivery: 

The weaponized payload is transmitted to the target. Common transmitters are email attachment, websites, USB removable media. 

## Exploitation:

Exploits the vulnerability of the target system. Most often targeting an application or operating system vulnerability. 

## Installation: 

The payload is installed in the target system, allows the adversary to persistence inside the environment. 

## Command and control (C2): 

The attacker establish control over the target system. Once the C2 channel establishes the intruders have “hand on keyboard” access on the compromised environment. 

## Actions and objectives: 

The intruders attain their objectives such as data breach, information theft etc.

# Intrusion Reconstruction:

It is a new model to deal with intrusion. Although there is already a model that exist, analysts must be open to improve and discover new way to prevent intrusion at the early stage. Defenders must be able to move their detection and analysis up the kill chain and identify the intrusion before it reaches the delivery stage.

# Campaign analysis:

The main goal off a campaign analysis is identify the pattern and behavior of the attackers, their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The goal is to detect ‘how’ they think rather than ‘what’ they do. Analyzing various kill chain intrusions on a regular basis will help detect commonality and repetition of the intruders.

# Case Study 1:

On March 2009 there was an attempt of intrusion where the attacker sent an email claiming to discuss about American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) conference. The intruder sent 2 PDF files as weapon, where 1 had backdoor installation of a trojan. There was a shell code within the PDF which if opened would automatically be installed in the C drive of the computer. EXE and HLP files would have saved in C drive and would result in a data breach. Because of successful mitigation and alert analysis this attack was prevented. There were 2 more attempts in next 2 weeks. The intruders tried different paths and ways but the defender’s found commonality and pattern in their attack which helped them prevent any damage. 

As the technology is advancing rapidly, the intruders are getting more efficient. Therefore is necessary to have intelligent driven computer defense network. 


## Creating a new virtual machine 

In the process of creating a new virtual machine first i downloaded Debian iso image. I choose the amd64. i use a M3 laptop and amd64 worked or me. Then i downloaded Virtual box installer and ran it. After starting the virtual box i went to menu and select new. I selected linux type, debian 64.

Went to the storage and selected creat virtual disk.

The next step was to install Debian which was on the bottom of the destop screen. Selected keyboard in English option and location Helsinki.

Intalling it took a few minutes. It is better if you dont close the window when intalling, making it faster.
